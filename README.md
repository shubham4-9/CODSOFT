# WORKING?
The calculator has an entrybox which accept the input value given by user from keyboard. It contains some buttons for user convenience which when pressed by user inserts the corresponding character in the entrybox. For displaying the output of the given expression we have an equal button which when clicked evaluates the result and display it in entry box. For clearing any wrong inputted character we have a clear button as well in it. 
If any invalid expression is encountered in the entry box an Error Message will be displayed in entry box.







# Additional Features
I have used python operators to add some functionality to ease. Generally these options are not available in normal hand used calculators.
1. ** (Exponential Operator): Using this button we can perform the exponential calculation. For eg: 2**5 is same as 2x2x2x2x2 so instead of writing  2 five times we can use this button for operation.
2. % (Module Operator): Using this button we can find out the remainder of a division. For eg: 32%2 wil give 0 as output as 32 is completely divisible by 2 and the remainder of this division expression is zero.
3. // (Floor Division Operator): This button will divide the first agrument by the second and round the result down to the nearest whole number. For eg: 17//4 will give result as 4 only.
